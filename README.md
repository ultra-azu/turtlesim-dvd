A DVD screensaver effect for turtlesim...kinda

# How to run
Just run `./build.sh`, it should build everything.
If you are in Xorg, per [here](https://askubuntu.com/a/1304947), run `xhost local:docker`.
Afterwards, run `sudo docker compose up` and it should work.

# Why?
For learning how ROS works. Also why not :P
